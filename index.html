# My PICO-8 Games ðŸŽ®

This is a collection of small games I made using [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

ðŸ‘‰ **Play them here:** [https://mamoru-miyagawa.github.io/pico8_prototypes/](https://mamoru-miyagawa.github.io/pico8_prototypes/)

## Games Included
- **Sauna Prototype** â€“ Heatbar prototype (folder: `sauna/`)
<!-- - **Game 2** â€“ A puzzle experiment (folder: `game2/`)
- **Game 3** â€“ A space shooter (folder: `game3/`) -->

## How it works
Each game is exported from PICO-8 as HTML and lives in its own folder.  
GitHub Pages hosts them automatically.

## Controls
PICO-8 default controls:
- Arrow keys = movement
- Z / X = action buttons
- Enter = pause menu

âœ¨ Enjoy playing!
