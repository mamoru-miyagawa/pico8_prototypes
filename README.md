# My PICO-8 Games ðŸŽ®

This is a collection of small games I made using [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

ðŸ‘‰ **Play them here:** [https://username.github.io/my-pico8-games/](https://username.github.io/my-pico8-games/)

## Games Included
- **Game 1** â€“ A little platformer (folder: `game1/`)
- **Game 2** â€“ A puzzle experiment (folder: `game2/`)
- **Game 3** â€“ A space shooter (folder: `game3/`)

## How it works
Each game is exported from PICO-8 as HTML and lives in its own folder.  
GitHub Pages hosts them automatically.

## Controls
PICO-8 default controls:
- Arrow keys = movement
- Z / X = action buttons
- Enter = pause menu

âœ¨ Enjoy playing!
