# Design Failure Modes: symptom → gate

Nine ways game design documentation goes wrong, what each looks like, and which gate or step catches it.

| # | Failure Mode | Symptom | Caught By |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Pillar drift** | Feature exists that doesn't trace to any pillar. The GDD becomes a wishlist. | Pillar Gate — every feature must name its pillar. |
| 2 | **Silent scope creep** | The feature count grew since the last review with no explicit approval. Nobody noticed until the timeline slipped. | Design Judge scope diff — compare against last checkpoint. |
| 3 | **Loop orphan** | A mechanic that doesn't connect to the core loop. Player progression that doesn't feed back into moment-to-moment gameplay. | Design Judge loop audit — every mechanic must map to a core loop phase. |
| 4 | **Tuning theater** | "Enemies get harder" without context. Compare: "Enemies get harder" (useless) vs "Enemies scale faster than the player, so fights get shorter and more lethal" (captures intent) vs "Enemy HP scales at 1.15x per level" (precise but will change). The fraud is prose that *sounds* specific without capturing *relationships*. | Design Judge tuning check — what matters is the intent and relationship, not the exact number. |
| 5 | **System isolation** | A system documented in isolation with no interaction list. The crafting system that doesn't reference the economy, or the combat system that ignores movement. | Pillar Gate System Check — "None" is not a valid interaction list. |
| 6 | **Fun claimed without proof** | "This will be fun" as the sole justification for a mechanic. No observable, testable criteria. | Design Judge fun check — "fun" must resolve to a specific player behavior or reaction. |
| 7 | **Audience mismatch** | Core mechanics designed for a different audience than defined. A reflex-based twitch mechanic in a game defined for casual players. | Design Judge audience check — every major mechanic checked against the audience definition. |
| 8 | **Feature costume** | Complexity masquerading as depth. 12 weapon types with no meaningful difference between them. A skill tree where every node is a +5% stat bonus. | Design Judge — an interaction count that exceeds the player's ability to make informed decisions is complexity, not depth. |
| 9 | **Unchecked pairwise gap** | Two mechanics exist that can interact, and the interaction is undocumented. The designer assumes it "obviously" works. QA finds it doesn't. | Pairwise Interaction Matrix — every pair must have a STATUS. |
| 10 | **Matrix rot** | The pairwise matrix exists but hasn't been updated since new features were added. Old pairs reference features that changed. | Design Judge pairwise scan — diff the matrix against current feature list. |
| 11 | **Scope budget denial** | "Everything is essential." No feature is ever removed or deferred. The budget was set but never enforced. | Scope Budget — when budget reaches 0, new features require removal of equal cost. No exceptions. |
| 12 | **GDD fossilization** | The GDD was written once at the start and never updated. The game has drifted but the document hasn't. | Design Judge — a GDD that hasn't been modified since the last production milestone is a fossil, not a design tool. |
| 13 | **Prototype gap** | A core loop described in prose that has never been prototyped or playtested. The team commits to production based on a theoretical loop. | Step 1 — Core Loop must be verified (prototype, paper test, or equivalent) before features are designed. |
| 14 | **False consensus** | All features pass the Pillar Gate because the pillars are too vague. "Fun." "Engaging." "Immersive." These filter nothing. | Vision Lock — pillars must be specific, observable, and contradictable. A pillar that can't be challenged is not a pillar. |
| 15 | **Design by meme** | "It's like Dark Souls meets Stardew Valley." The comparison replaces design thinking. Every feature is borrowed from the reference, none is owned. | Pillar Gate — comparisons identify the audience, not the features. Every feature still needs its own pillar trace. |
| 16 | **GDD-code drift** | The GDD says one thing, the code does another. A documented spec that the code silently contradicts. Designers argue from the GDD, engineers work from the code. | Code Audit — compare feature lists, tuning values, and behavior descriptions. Surface every delta. |
| 17 | **Silent removal** | A feature was cut from the code but still lives in the GDD. Future designers assume it exists. | Code Audit — `F_gdd \ F_code` shows documented-but-unimplemented features. |
| 18 | **Undocumented feature** | A feature was added to the code but never entered the GDD. Future designers don't know it exists. | Code Audit — `F_code \ F_gdd` shows implemented-but-undocumented features. Run through Pillar Gate + Pairwise Matrix. |
| 19 | **MDA mismatch** | The designer thinks the game evokes Challenge (deep tactics) but the mechanics actually produce Submission (grinding, repetition). | MDA Analysis — predict the aesthetic profile before building. Verify it in playtest. If the profile doesn't match pillars, change mechanics. |
| 20 | **Pillar-pillar denial** | Two pillars are in active tension but the designer pretends they aren't. Both are treated as absolute, with no trade-off acknowledged. Tension builds until one pillar silently dominates and the game drifts. | Pillar Judge — explicitly trace every pillar-pillar tension. Log to tensions.md. A tension that isn't named will be resolved by accident. |

## Reading these as a designer

The most expensive failures in practice are **system isolation** (5) — because it's discovered in integration testing months later — and **unchecked pairwise gaps** (9) — because it creates bugs that feel like edge cases but are actually design omissions. If an audit can only check two things, check those.
